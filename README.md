## 📺 Mission Overview
**AwaazSetu** is a next-generation voice-first platform engineered for the **300M+ Indians** who face literacy and language barriers. While the internet is vast, it remains inaccessible to rural populations due to complex text interfaces.

AwaazSetu transforms complex government portals (Cowin, PM Kisan, NFSA) into a **simple, spoken conversation**, creating a zero-touch digital bridge for the last mile of humanity.

## 🌟 Elite Features & Architecture

### 🧠 Massive Knowledge Engine (250+ Scenarios)
Unlike basic chatbots, AwaazSetu is pre-trained on **12 Master Categories** covering the entire spectrum of Indian civic life:
* **Health:** Ayushman Bharat, Jan Aushadhi, Mental Health (Tele-MANAS).
* **Rights:** Maternity Benefits, Disability (UDID), Senior Citizen Welfare.
* **Emergency:** Instant connections to Police (100), Ambulance (108), and Fire (101).

### 🛡️ Zero-Hallucination Intent System
In critical sectors like Healthcare, accuracy is non-negotiable. AwaazSetu rejects the unpredictability of standard LLMs in favor of a deterministic **Keyword-Intent Engine**. This ensures users get **100% verified, life-saving data** every time, with zero false information.

### 📡 Radar-Pulse UI & "Hinglish" NLP
* **Visual Feedback:** Features a custom CSS "Radar Ripple" animation that provides intuitive visual cues for listening states.
* **Linguistic Resilience:** Optimized to understand "Hinglish" (Hindi-English mix), making the technology feel invisible to non-tech-savvy users.

## 📱 Ecosystem Expansion: Sarthi
> **Note to Judges:** To extend accessibility beyond the browser, I independently architected a native Android solution.
